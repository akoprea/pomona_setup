===== LOGIN/WINDOW-MANAGER PROCESS =====
uses systemd-boot (bootctl).
custom /etc/issue to show cool logo.
default login (no greeter)
file .bash_profile runs:
- startx (starts x server), and redirects output to trash to keep terminal clear after login.
x-server looks at file .xinitrc, which:
- sets cursor size.
- sets bar name -- either with script ~/Scripts/dwm_clock.sh or via sbar (~/.#/sbar/).
- configs monitors using xrandr (more x-server stuff).
- sets wallpapers using feh.
- starts picom compositor (see ~/config/picom/picom.conf).
- finally starts dwm. window manager finally displays.
